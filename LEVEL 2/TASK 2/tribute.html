          <h2>MOTHER TERESA</h2>
          <p><b>Mother Teresa was a beloved humanitarian and Catholic nun. Born on August 26, 1910, in Skopje, North Macedonia, she dedicated her life to serving the poor and marginalized in society. Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity in 1950, a religious order that provided assistance to the destitute, sick, and dying. Her selfless work in Kolkata, India, and around the world earned her international recognition and numerous awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979. </b></p>
